## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I gained two key insights:

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup**: I discovered that using semantic elements greatly improves the structure and readability of a page, making it more meaningful and easier to navigate.

- **Lists**: Styling lists to match the design required extensive research. In the process, I learned a lot about different types of lists, such as unordered, ordered, and description lists (something I hadnâ€™t explored before), as well as list styling, markers, and customization options.

### Useful resources

- [web.dev > learn > css > list](https://web.dev/learn/css/lists?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fcss%23article-https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fcss%2Flists) - This resource was invaluable for understanding the nuances of list styling.

- [HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) -  A detailed reference covering nearly 100 semantic HTML elements.
